Recipient: Grace Yu Legal Defense Team Amount: 50,000 ATOM (~approx $610,000 at current prices) Summary: On 3/23/23, All in Bits, Inc., (AiB) filed a legal complaint against Grace Yu, a former AIB contractor, for the alleged breach of a mutual non-disparagement clause. AiB seeks damages to be determined at trial, and asks the amount be 'not less than $150,000.'In our view, the lawsuit initiated by AiB constitutes a tortious act, which may result in unwarranted scrutiny and legal implications for $ATOM and the Cosmos network.  Let it be known that AiB has filed and financed a frivolous lawsuit against a community member utilizing funds given to them for the assumed propagation and development of open-source software. It is our utmost concern that AiB initiated this legal action without a sound basis in a federal court lacking genuine jurisdiction, rendering the Cosmos network vulnerable to ramifications of AiB’s pleadings that declare the core technology framework to be both centralized and dominated by a founding Cosmos entity. In light of this negative precedent established with AiB’s lawsuit, the objective of this proposal is to rectify the situation with a positive, restorative precedent. This proposal is designed to lend unequivocal support to Grace – for her fortitude in prioritizing the public interest in our public goods, over the limited interests of a private entity. At this critical growth juncture, it is paramount that we assertively demand radical transparency from our founding organizations; however, this goal is rendered unachievable when tort systems are exploited to effect intimidation and harassment. We earnestly implore the community to consider the full contents of this proposal, as its approval will signify and secure a commitment of resources needed to defend Grace and provide evidence to the American fiat courts that the Cosmos ecosystem – that our code and our culture, are truly decentralized products and experiences. The full text of this proposal is available via **Objective: Based on projected costs provided by law firms, we are requesting 50,000 ATOM to secure competent legal representation for Grace Yu. Grace will be seeking reimbursement for all legal costs and expenses from AIB.  Grace will work with Notional for any remittance/reimbursement of funds back to the Cosmos Hub community pool. As of 4/5/23, AiB has communicated that in the event the Cosmos Hub passes a funding proposal for Grace’s legal defense fund, AiB 'will reimburse the Cosmos community for the portion used.' In the event the outcome of a settlement or a trial works in favor of the petitioner, and damages are awarded to AiB; Grace will not use any of the funds allocated to pay for damages. Funds allocated will be used strictly for her legal defense, only.",
